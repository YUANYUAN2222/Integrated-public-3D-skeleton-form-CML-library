The process of integreting HDM05 dataset to CML.
(1) USing the folder "matlab-AMC-HDM05" to parse skeleton data and stored in the file 'processed'. and the parse tool reference from 'https://github.com/lawrennd/mocap'
(2) The code of "mat_to_txt"processe the skeleton data form .mat to .txt. and the following issues will be resolved during this process.
* Processing the number and position of joints
* Processing the sampling rate
* Processing the unit
* Transformation coordinate system
* Processing the file format
